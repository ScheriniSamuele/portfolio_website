## Porfolio Website

This is a simple template for a portfolio website made only with HTML and CSS I built for myself.
It is designed for developers and software engineers.

The initial design has been done with Figma software.

I chose to implement the website using only HTML and CSS for better performances and to show my skills with simple but effective CSS layouts and colors.
